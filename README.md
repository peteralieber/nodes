# Nodes

This repository is a monorepo of all my framework exploration for simple graph/ui applications.

I am interested in creating apps that use nodes or heirarchical navigation to:

- Generate Code
- Perform actions in sequence or graph
- Keep track of data, inventories, or projects

I will be using a variety of frameworks to try them out and compare.

1. HTMX
   The first I am trying is HTMX, as I remember fondly the days of building everything within the confines of HTML and CSS.
   One thing that became immediately obvious is that HTMX is focused on providing AJAX functionality, and replacing HTML
   elements by server request. Front-end behavior and user interaction isn't necessarily the focus (although some of their
   examples show how to do CSS transitions, but really it is replacing the entire outerHtml just to change the class of the
   element). I may look at extending HTMX with some front-end or local behaviors.
